Developing IDA plugins in C#

This is a first version of a port of the ClassInformer plugin from Sirmabus & VivyaCC into C#.
It works with IDA from version 7.7 to 8.3 (Freeware and Pro versions).
The final intention is to have the posibility of writing C# plugins for IDA thus extending the plugin development from C++ & Python.
